# Donation Aggregator

## What is this?

### Overview

The Donation Aggregator was created to simplify the process of working with and
analyzing FEC donation information. In its default form, the information found in
the .csv file generated by the FEC search client is littered with duplicate entries.
This is particularly egregious for frequent donors or those who use services which
distribute donations across multiple campaigns or causes.

This tool aims to fix that problem by pulling together all of the various donations
from a single person (as determined by their full name) in the given file. Each organization 
that a person has donated to gets a new line in the output data sheet, with the donors name
listed alongside the total amount of donations that were found in the data set.

Due to the nature and limitations of this tool, however, discrepancies between the names that
donors entered can result in duplicate entries. Since these donations are self-reported,
there are sometimes typos or inconsistent name entries (e.g. those entered with or without a 
middle name) which this tool is unable to recognize as a single set of donations.

## Usage

Data sets must be saved as `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xltx`, or `.xltm` files for this tool to 
work, with the source data being the first sheet in the Workbook.

```
usage: DonationAggregator [-h] [-n] [-c] [-d] filename

This tool is designed to simplify the process of analyzing and interpreting
the data found in FEC donation information by aggregating donations for each
